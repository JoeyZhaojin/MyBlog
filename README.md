Follow these simple steps to download the .zip file and run the node app.js command.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Node.js
1. A text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Download and extract the .zip file

1. Open the project folder

    Open the extracted folder using your preferred text editor. For example, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the folder by selecting File > Open Folder from the top menu.

1. Install dependencies

    To open the terminal in Visual Studio Code, go to Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu. If you are using another text editor or command prompt, navigate to the project folder using the cd command followed by the folder path.
    Before running the node app.js command, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
    
1. Run the node app.js command
    Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the node app.js command. In the terminal, enter the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    node app.js
    ```
    The application should now start running. You will see output messages in the terminal if the application is running successfully.
